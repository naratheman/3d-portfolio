      Hey there! I'm a tech enthusiast with a mix of skillsâ€”Python, React, React Native, Swift, TypeScript, Flutter, Dart, SQL, you name it. I love diving into different roles and taking charge of features, making sure they're not just lines of code but actually make a difference.
      My thing is wearing many hats and thriving in dynamic environments. I've got a knack for owning features and driving them to success. What really gets me going is creating software that brings a positive change to the world.
      Right now, I'm on the lookout for software development gigs. I'm all about roles that let me use my skills in a collaborative and innovative setup. If it's a place where I can make a meaningful impact and keep learning, count me in! Let's make some cool stuff together. 
      </motion.p>

      <div className='mt-20 flex flex-wrap gap-10'>
        {services.map((service, index) => (
          <ServiceCard 
            key={service.title}
            index={index}
            {...service}
          />
        ))}
      </div>

    </>
  )
};

export default SectionWrapper(About, "about");
